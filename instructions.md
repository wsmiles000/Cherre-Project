# Cherre programming exercise
## Instructions
Given the attached SQLiteDB (testdb.db), make a program in any language which does the following:
1. find the ten people who have visited the most sites
2. list these people in descending order of the number of sites they've visited in a table called FrequentBrowsers
3. upload your solution, along with instructions on how to run it, to a public repository on GitHub
4. email the repository link to Cherre

## Considerations
We'd love to see what other cool stuff you can do!  

Possible additions . . . 
- provide a Dockerfile to run the solution in container
- provide an API to expose the results to the world
- unit tests
- on-board documentation
